            <p id="A">in sub-Saharan Africa. Here – where governments often have little ability to raise tax revenue and mobilise other financial resources – aid should be used to create favourable conditions for catalysing other forms of resources for ending poverty, such as private investment and development finance. </p>

                <h1>2. Commit governments to ending poverty.</h1>
                <p id="C">Governments of developing countries should commit to lifting their citizens above the line of $1.25 per day. This needs to be underpinned by national mechanisms that target and support people living in poverty.
The Bolsa Familia programme in Brazil transfers cash directly to poor households, and decisions about allocation are based on assessments of depth of poverty rather than household composition. More than 48 million people are now enrolled in the programme. Thanks to the contribution of Bolsa Familia, extreme poverty in Brazil dropped from 20.4 million in 2003 to approximately 11.9 million in 2009.
Only five governments have commited publically to ending poverty (Brazil, Colombia, Malawi, UK and USA), and approximately 50 have made similar commitments at World Bank meetings. But ALL countries need to make this commitment if we are going to end extreme poverty by 2030.</p>

                <h1>5. Go country by country.</h1>
                <p id="D">The governments of developing countries must follow their commitments with action through national poverty reduction plans. Strategic and joined-up approaches to ending extreme poverty would enable ownership over the way that public, private and aid resources are allocated and used.</p>
